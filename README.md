# numix-gnome-shell

A GNOME 3 shell that is intended to fit well with the Numix theme.

Based on a project of the same name: https://bitbucket.org/jcarle/numix-gnome-shell/src/master/

The Inter font is used. Find it to use this theme correctly.

Has the notification color issue fixed, and a bunch of other customization according to my liking.
